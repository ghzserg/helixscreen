# Changelog

All notable changes to HelixScreen will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.9.4] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- Pre-print time predictions based on historical heating/homing data
- Heater status text on temperature cards (Heating, Cooling, At Target)
- Slicer estimated time fallback for remaining time
- Seconds in duration display under 5 minutes

### Fixed
- Crash on 16bpp HDMI screens from forced 32-bit color format
- Elapsed time using wall-clock duration instead of print-only time
- Pre-print overlay showing when it shouldn't
- Backlight not turning off on AD5M
- Heater status colors (heating=red, added cooling state)
- AMS row hidden when no AMS connected
- Modal button alignment
- Install script version detection on Pi (#6)

## [0.9.3] - 2026-02-06

First public beta release. Core features are complete — we're looking for early
adopters to help find edge cases.

**Supported platforms:** Raspberry Pi (aarch64), FlashForge AD5M (armv7l),
Creality K1 (MIPS32)

> **Note:** K1 binaries are included but have not been tested on hardware. If you
> have a K1, we'd love your help verifying it works!

### Added
- Print start profiles with modular, JSON-driven signal matching for per-printer phase detection
- NetworkManager WiFi backend for broader Linux compatibility
- `.3mf` file support in print file browser
- Non-printable file filtering in print selection
- Beta features gating system for experimental UI (HelixPrint plugin)
- Platform detection and preset system for zero-config installs
- Settings action rows with bind_description for richer UI
- Restart logic consolidated into single `app_request_restart_service()` entry point

### Fixed
- Print start collector not restarting after a completed print
- Sequential progress regression on repeated signals during print start
- Bed mesh triple-rendering and profile row click targets
- Wizard WiFi step layout, password visibility toggle, and dropdown corruption
- Touch calibration skipped for USB HID touchscreens (HDMI displays)
- CJK glyph inclusion from C++ sources in font generation
- File ownership for non-root deploy targets
- Console cursor hidden on fbdev displays

### Changed
- Pi deploys now use `systemctl restart` instead of stop/start
- fbdev display backend for Pi (avoids DRM master contention)
- Comprehensive architectural documentation from 5-agent audit
- Troubleshooting guide updated with debug logging instructions

## [0.9.2] - 2026-02-05

Major internal release with live theming, temperature sensor support, and
extensive UI polish across all panels.

### Added
- Live theme switching without restart — change themes in settings instantly
- Dark/light gradient backgrounds and themed overlay constants
- Full-screen 3D splash images with dark/light mode support
- Temperature sensor manager for auxiliary temp sensors (chamber, enclosure, etc.)
- Responsive fan dial with knob glow effect
- Software update checker with download progress and install-during-idle safety
- Platform hook architecture for modularized installer functions
- Auto-detect Pi install path from Klipper ecosystem
- AD5M preset with auto-detection for zero-config setup
- Beta features config flag for gating experimental UI
- CJK glyph support (Chinese, Japanese, Russian) in generated fonts
- Pencil edit icons next to temperature controls
- OS version, MCU versions, and printer name in About section
- Shell tests (shellcheck, bats) gating release builds

### Fixed
- Shutdown crash: stop animations before destroying panels to prevent use-after-free
- Observer crash: reorder display/subject teardown sequence
- Stale widget pointer guards for temperature and fan updates
- Theme palette preservation across dark/light mode switches
- Button text contrast for layout=column buttons with XML children
- Navbar background not updating on theme toggle
- Dropdown corruption with `&#10;` newline entities in XML
- Wizard initialization: fan subscriptions, sensor select, toast suppression
- Kinematics detection and Z button icons for bed-moves printers
- Bed mesh data normalization and zero plane visibility
- Filament panel deferred `set_limits` to main thread
- Touch calibration target spread and full-screen capture

### Changed
- Pi builds target Debian Bullseye for wider compatibility
- Static-link OpenSSL for cross-platform SSL support
- Binaries relocated to `bin/` subdirectory in deploy packages
- Fan naming uses configured roles instead of heuristics
- HelixScreen brand theme set as default
- Installer modularized with platform dispatchers
- Release build timeout increased to 60 minutes

## [0.9.1] - 2026-02-04

Initial tagged release. Foundation for all subsequent development.

### Added
- 30 panels and 16 overlays covering full printer control workflow
- First-run setup wizard with 8-step guided configuration
- Multi-material support: AFC, Happy Hare, tool changers, ValgACE, Spoolman
- G-code preview and 3D bed mesh visualization
- Calibration tools: input shaper, mesh leveling, screws tilt, PID, firmware retraction
- Internationalization system with hot-reload language switching
- Light and dark themes with responsive 800x480+ layout
- Cross-compilation for Pi (aarch64), AD5M (armv7l), K1 (MIPS32)
- Automated GitHub Actions release pipeline
- One-liner installation script with platform auto-detection
